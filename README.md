# Sysmap - Automated Literature Review to Identify Modeling Trends in the Field of Human-Computer-Interaction
### Lea Gihlein & Konstantin Ripke

This repository is used to provide the code for our project as part of the Human Computer Interaction Course at the University Leipzig / ScaDS.AI Leipzig in 2024/25.

*In general: to run the scripts, you have to set up a new database, because the one we used is not online anymore. A backup of the Database can be found in our project's OSF storage.*

To run the code, the following changes have to be made:
- input your LLM API-Key at the beginning of the scripts / set it as an environment variable
- change the file path of the database certificate to where it was saved on your machine
