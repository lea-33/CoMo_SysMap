### Lea Gihlein & Konstantin Ripke

This repository is used to provide the code for our project as part of the Human Computer Interaction Course at the University Leipzig / ScaDS.AI Leipzig in 2024/25.

To run the code, the following changes have to be made:
- if neccessary, input your LLM Api-Key at the beginning of the scripts for classification
- change the file path to the database certificate to where it was saved on your machine
